A Beginner Friendly library to interface MPU6050 with Arduino

## Overview

The MPU6050 is an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) that can provide data like linear accelaration and angular velocity. It does this by using an inbuilt accelerometer and gyroscope. Additionally, it also provides temperature data.

This library consists of functions that can be used to retrieve this data from an MPU6050 connected to a microcontroller

> The library is tested on an Arduino UNO but is expected to work well with any microcontroller that can be programmed using Arduino IDE.
